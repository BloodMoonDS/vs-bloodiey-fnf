# Mods and DLCS
This files are for manipulating the mod's assets and on-screen things outside mod's folder and without having to modify the mod's assets
<code>
registerDLC(String:name, String:dlcSerial)
</code> helps to add your mods as dlc's
also <code>
patchAsMod(String:name, int:id)
</code> helps you to make skin mods without having to replace files and having to make backups

NOTE: <code>
registerDLC(String:name, String:dlcSerial)
</code> Doesn't allow asset replacement so please only additions



documantation coming soon :D
