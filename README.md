Psych Engine is currently experiencing problems with The most recent version of flixel!!! the mod is being delayed until further advice, I'll try fixing the problem while I can.

## About

Bloodiey is a cat with a secret power hiding behind his cute face want to know it? play it now!

this mod adds a cat that could be cute but this cat has a huge power where actually can destroy everything if he wants.

but he dont want that obviously.

this is and old reimagination from my old mod.
<https://www.mediafire.com/file/f1bacidsa7hrwd6/mod_shido_xd.rar/file>

also you have o install haxeflixel v 4.2.4.

after installation run setup.bat this will do the things for you automatically
NOTE: the fisrt steps you have to take care of the windows, it will ask you some things.
